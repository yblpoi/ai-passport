# Reference

This area holds reference material for AI Passport development that is not a
binding requirement: reusable development experience and archived application
playbooks. These are consulted when developing something new, not enforced as
rules. Reference is organized by contributing developer's GitHub username: under
each repository-relative `docs/reference/<username>/` folder, experience entries
are stored as flat files and application playbooks as subdirectories.

The engineering rules themselves live under
[`../development/`](../development/README.md); the collaboration conventions under
[`../contribution/`](../contribution/README.md).

### Shinku-Chen

**Experience entries:**

- [Audio Compression Trade-offs on ESP32-C3](shinku-chen/audio-compression-trade-offs.md) — how a voice-playback codec was chosen on limited flash (IMA-ADPCM vs Opus vs MP3), with measured capacity and decoder cost.
- [Post-Release Follow-up for the AI Passport Publishing Flow](shinku-chen/post-release-follow-up.md) — confirm the publish destination, include the data partition in a release, and the consent gates for the post-release tracks.
- [Display Refresh and Deep-sleep on ESP32-C3 (No PSRAM)](shinku-chen/display-refresh-and-deep-sleep.md) — direct panel refresh of a single image rect, RTC-GPIO deep-sleep wakeup, and the LVGL object-type misuse crash signature.
- [Shutting Down On-Board Peripherals Before Deep-Sleep](shinku-chen/deep-sleep-peripheral-power-off.md) — verified register shutdown, shared-bus ordering, terminal GPIO states, LCD deep-sleep holds, the `esp_codec_dev_close()` opened-state trap, and remaining hardware loads.
- [Idle Power Behind an Always-On BLE Link](shinku-chen/ble-active-idle-power.md) — DFS but no system light sleep while the link is up, counting only real traffic as activity, codec suspend and wake, and reconciling with the device's own frame counters.
- [Landscape Rotation and a Deep-sleep Key Wake](shinku-chen/landscape-rotation-and-deep-sleep-key-wake.md) — rotating a portrait panel to a 320 × 240 landscape screen through LVGL, why the corner mask must follow the logical resolution, and how an ADC-owned pin makes a low-level deep-sleep wake fire at sleep entry.
- [Idle Power Stages and Wake Guards](shinku-chen/idle-power-stages-and-wake-guards.md) — a key held through a deep-sleep boot being graded a long press and the release-following guard that fixes it, why automatic light sleep stretches countdowns built on `skip_unhandled_events` timers, and what stopping the radio really costs when a protocol keeps retrying.
- [Wall-clock Budgets for On-Device Game AI](shinku-chen/on-device-game-ai-wall-clock-budget.md) — why node-count limits misfire on this board (about 15k nodes per second), iterative deepening against a time budget, yielding to keep the idle task fed, and difficulty as a blunder rate.
- [Size Static Buffers from the Panel, and Verify the Release Artifact](shinku-chen/release-artifact-verification.md) — a 51 KB buffer mistake that left 8 KB of free heap, reading the startup log of the published merged image, and replacing a just-published release instead of shipping a follow-up.
- [Two-Device BLE Link Between AI Passport Boards (No PSRAM)](shinku-chen/two-device-ble-link.md) — symmetric peer discovery with an address tiebreak instead of host/join, measured link heap on a no-PSRAM part and its conflict with a static screenshot buffer, two hardware-only NimBLE GATT traps (missing `access_cb`, `EDONE` after a successful subscribe), NVS for RF calibration, and a stop-and-wait layer for turn-based play.
- [A Packed Asset Name Is a Contract Between the Packer and the Firmware](shinku-chen/asset-pack-name-contract.md) — a lookup the pack does not answer is a silent blank screen, why the placeholder pack hid the mismatch, the host test that compares packer names with the firmware's lookup literals, and the partition budget.
- [What Flashing a Merged Image Does to Stored Data](shinku-chen/merged-image-flashing-and-stored-data.md) — the merged image carries `0xFF` over NVS without reliably clearing it, and how to keep or clear stored data on purpose.
- [CJK Bitmap Font Subsets for LVGL 9](shinku-chen/lvgl-cjk-font-subsets.md) — building a purpose-built Chinese subset for a fixed screen: LVGL's cmap lookup semantics, PLAIN 4bpp packing, why `lv_font_conv` wrote corrupt bitmaps under current Node.js, whitespace glyphs such as U+3000, and self-verifying the generated C file pixel by pixel.
- [Packing a Visual Novel Into One Flash-Mapped Blob](shinku-chen/packed-visual-novel-data.md) — one little-endian pack read straight out of flash, stripping engine directives from the script at pack time, pre-cropped backgrounds and 1bpp-masked sprites, and traceable provenance.
- [Verifying a Ported Visual Novel's Story Graph](shinku-chen/visual-novel-story-graph-verification.md) — proving every chapter and scene is reachable, enumerating choice combinations to prove each ending, and the interaction rules that sit on top (fast-forward stops at choices; skip-chapter stops at an unreached choice).
- [Three-Key Reader Interaction on the AI Passport](shinku-chen/three-key-reader-interaction.md) — the button driver merges quick taps into a double click, hold-to-repeat needs a long-press threshold plus the release event, and lists must clamp at the ends instead of wrapping.
- [LVGL Font Format Traps and Glyph-Coverage Gates](shinku-chen/lvgl-font-format-and-glyph-coverage.md) — the `FORMAT0_FULL` crash on LVGL 9.6, the TINY plus SPARSE_TINY workaround for an arbitrary CJK subset, per-pixel readback of the emitted font, and a static coverage gate over the application's own strings.
- [Compositing Full-Screen Scenes Without PSRAM](shinku-chen/lossless-sprite-compositing-without-psram.md) — JPEG backgrounds decoded straight into the canvas while sprites and overlays use RGB565 plus a 4 bpp alpha mask cropped to the bounding box, with the measured pack split and composite cost.
- [Three-Key Input Semantics: Only Clicks and Long Presses Are User Intent](shinku-chen/three-key-input-event-semantics.md) — why a mode toggled by a long press died on its own release event, the press-timing constants, callback discipline in the shared timer task, and the activity-versus-waiting distinction for the idle timers.
- [Hands-Off Auto-Advance: Pace from the End of the Text](shinku-chen/hands-off-auto-advance-modes.md) — a fixed 700 ms dwell after the typewriter, surviving chapter transitions, stopping at decisions, and counting the mode as activity so an unattended run keeps the screen lit.
- [Capturing the Real Screen from the LVGL Flush Path](shinku-chen/lvgl-flush-path-frame-capture.md) — reusing the art canvas as the frame store, why `lv_snapshot` wipes a canvas-backed UI, holding the LVGL lock for the whole transfer, the debug-task stack a full re-render needs, and where to hook so the bytes are still LVGL-native.
- [Asset Packs: Make a Field Drift Fail Loudly](shinku-chen/asset-pack-field-drift.md) — a sprite-owner field the packer wrote and the reader never read, why count thresholds passed anyway, and the three habits that catch it (assert distributions, cross-dump one record from both sides, let the producer assert the invariant).
- [What "the Sprite Follows the Speaker" Costs](shinku-chen/speaker-driven-sprite-cost.md) — 3,444 of 11,777 dialogue steps draw a sprite, 5,837 full recomposites over the story, why the 84 KB clean-base cache does not fit without PSRAM, and the knobs worth trying in order.
- [Sizing the LVGL Pool and Proving CJK Glyph Coverage](shinku-chen/lvgl-pool-and-glyph-coverage.md) — size the pool for the worst page instead of the average (24 KB corrupts the UI, 56 KB works), the renamed LVGL 9 pool key, and why a data-generated CJK subset needs a gate that scans the sources too.
- [Answering `FAP_SCREENSHOT_V1` Without a Spare Frame Buffer](shinku-chen/fap-screenshot-without-frame-buffer.md) — the community publisher's serial protocol on a no-PSRAM board: two-pass capture over the art canvas instead of a 150 KB frame buffer, a driver fast path that turns a 56 s frame into 1.7 s, dropped 2048-byte chunks, log bytes interleaving with the payload, and where the USB-Serial-JTAG driver may be installed.
- [Deriving CJK Line Pitch from Font Metrics](shinku-chen/cjk-line-pitch-from-font-metrics.md) — why a generated 16 px CJK subset reports a 20 px line height, how the copied "em size minus 16" spacing overflowed a five-line dialogue box, and the static assert that keeps page layout and label box in agreement.
- [Cleaning a Ported Script Dataset Before It Reaches the Reader](shinku-chen/ported-script-text-cleanup.md) — inline layout directives and leaked translator memos inside a hand-edited dataset, the packer-side rules that remove them without touching dialogue, and the regression that keeps ordinary punctuation safe.
- [Shared Block Buffers Need One Owner](shinku-chen/shared-block-buffer-caches.md) — why per-stream caches over one shared decompression buffer decode the wrong stream from the second page on, why single-frame screenshots cannot see it, and the continuity tests that do.
- [Porting Games Whose Source Is a Linear Page Table](shinku-chen/linear-page-table-ports.md) — compiling a JavaScript branch configuration into verified data tables, packing pages and text as block streams, sorting the chapter list by page, and the duplicated-block loop and route-reachability checks to run before shipping.

- [Packing a Visual-Novel Script for a No-PSRAM Board](shinku-chen/vn-script-pack-budget-and-failure-modes.md) — a 5.06 MB script packed into 1.45 MB, why the chunk size is set by the largest free block (7.7 KB, not by the free heap), and three unrelated defects that all presented as "the story ends immediately" plus the boot self-check that named them.
- [A BLE Voice Uplink Where the Phone Does the Networking](shinku-chen/ble-voice-uplink-and-pairing.md) — keeping the board a pure BLE peripheral so no credential or Wi-Fi setup ever reaches it: NUS framing with magic re-sync, LE Secure Connections pairing with a 6-digit passkey, Opus at about 3 KB/s on a no-PSRAM part, metered audio flow, and a key-down-driven screen reaction with a bounded fallback.
- [When a Newer Toolchain Makes the Firmware Unbootable](shinku-chen/iram-dram-alias-and-toolchain-pitfall.md) — why IRAM code and DRAM data are the same SRAM on the ESP32-C3, how a 16-byte source change plus a newer compiler cost 4 KB of heap (`\.dram0\.dummy` is a mirror of the IRAM image), and the three numbers to compare before flashing.
- [An ADC Ladder Keypad Can Read a Long Press as Another Key](shinku-chen/adc-ladder-keypad-long-press-misread.md) — three keys on one ADC pin behind voltage windows, how a momentary contact break in a held key sweeps the voltage through another key's window and its watchers, the key-identity lock that fixes it, and the key-event black box that records the ADC millivolts behind every event.
- [Packing a Visual Novel into 8 MB with No PSRAM](shinku-chen/packing-a-visual-novel-into-8mb-no-psram.md) — a 5.26 MB image pack and a 1.43 MB script pack around a 7.7 KB largest free block: why the ROM's inflate did not fit, the 3 KB block ceilings and the compression ratio they cost, native-geometry packing, and two silent failures caused by fixed-size limits.

## Adding an experience entry

Each release may produce **one or more** reusable, post-release learnings; each is
added as its own entry (with the release tag or commit as context). Follow the
repository language rule: keep the default `.md` path in English and the paired
`.zh_CN.md` in Simplified Chinese, aligned in the same change.

An entry is a single `.md` file (with its `.zh_CN.md` peer) stored flat under
`docs/reference/<username>/` and named after the entry's content summary in
lowercase-kebab-case (e.g. `audio-compression-trade-offs.md`), describing the
topic rather than an opaque timestamp. Each entry is routed before submission:
general, upstream-benefiting experience goes to the upstream
`FoloToy/ai-passport` as a PR; fork-specific customization stays in the fork per
[`docs/fork-guide.md`](../fork-guide.md).

## Archiving an application

When an application is published, archive it under the repository-relative
`docs/reference/<username>/<app-name>/`
with an AI-generated bilingual functional summary (`README.md` / `.zh_CN.md`) and
optionally a how-to guide. The archive is **text-only** — record the cover image
by file name and format only, and do not store the firmware `.bin`. The `plays-archive`
skill drives the archive and its convention. Add the application to this index
and its Simplified Chinese peer in the same change.
